# Hello World!

Welcome to our blog! We are a group of six students from
the [University of Applied Sciences Howest](https://howest.be/en) in Belgium, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied
Computer Science.

## Purpose of this blog

This blog is part of our International Project module, which provided us with the opportunity to collaborate with
students from other countries and expand our knowledge beyond the classroom. For this project, twenty students of our
school were allowed to go to the [University of Skövde](https://www.his.se/en/) in Skövde, Sweden.

## What to Expect

On this blog we will be sharing our experiences and insights from our time in Sweden. We will be posting about our
adventures, the things we learned, and the people we met. We will also be sharing our thoughts on the differences
between our two countries and cultures.

## Enjoy the read!

We hope you enjoy reading our blog as much as we enjoyed writing it! Going to Sweden was an amazing experience for all
of us, and we are very grateful for the opportunity. We would like to thank our teachers for making this possible, and
the University of Skövde for welcoming us with open arms.

Thank you for visiting our blog!
